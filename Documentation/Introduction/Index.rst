This extension allowes to generate quizzes for frontend users. Quizzes may consist of an arbitrary number of questions, each with an arbitrary number of possible answers. It can be defined per question whether just one or multiple answers can be chosen. It is possible to combine multiple choice answers and single choice answers in the same quiz.

Each answer has a point value attached to it. After answering all questions of a quiz the user is redirected to a page - depending upon the points they collected by their answers.
